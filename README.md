# üåç Introduction to Cloud-Based Remote Sensing with Google Earth Engine (GEE)

This repository provides a curated collection of educational scripts written in JavaScript for use in the [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/) (GEE) Code Editor. These examples are designed for early-stage graduate students or anyone starting to explore cloud-based remote sensing. The goal is to introduce key analytical techniques‚Äîsuch as time series visualization, pansharpening, land surface temperature retrieval, and land cover classification‚Äîthrough hands-on, interpretable code.

Each script is self-contained and demonstrates a specific concept using publicly available satellite imagery from platforms like Sentinel-5P and Landsat 9. These examples were developed as part of a remote sensing teaching module at the Master's level and are structured to support both instructors and independent learners.

## üîç Contents

### 1. `pollutionTimeSeries.js`
Visualizes NO‚ÇÇ concentration trends over time using Sentinel-5P (TROPOMI) data:
- Clips to a defined Area of Interest (AOI)
- Computes mean NO‚ÇÇ values
- Plots a scatter chart to analyze temporal variation

### 2. `PanSharpening_Intensity-Hue-Saturation.js`
Pansharpens Landsat 9 imagery using the IHS method:
- Converts RGB to HSV color space
- Replaces 'Value' with the panchromatic band
- Converts back to RGB for a sharper visual

### 3. `PanSharpening_Brovey.js`
Uses the Brovey Transform to merge high-resolution panchromatic data with multispectral bands:
- Enhances spatial details
- Maintains spectral balance in RGB + NIR

### 4. `LST_calculation.js`
Calculates Land Surface Temperature (LST) from Landsat 9 Level 2 imagery:
- Applies scaling factors to the ST_B10 band
- Converts from Kelvin to Celsius
- Visualizes LST with a color ramp

### 5. `supervisedClassification.js`
Performs supervised land cover classification using a Random Forest model:
- Computes NDVI and NDBI
- Trains a classifier on labeled features (e.g., water, vegetation, impervious surfaces)
- Outputs a classified map and accuracy assessment
- Includes optional export to Google Drive

### 6. `unsupervisedClassification.js`
Executes unsupervised classification using K-means clustering:
- Generates a median composite
- Clusters pixels into land cover classes without training data
- Visualizes clustered image with a distinct palette

## üõ† Requirements

- Google Earth Engine account
- Familiarity with JavaScript and basic remote sensing principles
- Predefined geometry (`geometry` or `table`) for AOI
- (Optional) Pre-labeled training FeatureCollections (`W`, `G`, `I`) for supervised classification

## üìå Notes

- All scripts are ready to run in the GEE Code Editor.
- You may need to adapt AOI, image dates, or band selections based on your study region or use case.
- These scripts are intentionally simplified for educational clarity.
